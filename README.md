# Spritzy Drink Suggestion App
Project description: Mixed-drink suggestion app

**Welcome to the Spritzy Drink App wiki!**

## User story:
Type of user: As a 21 year old (of legal age) person that is a bartender, social event coordinator/planner, and anyone interested in finding new mixed drink suggestions.

## Goal: 
We want to create a web app that searches online for ingredients to make new mixed drinks when user inputs the event theme, fruit options they want to include in their drink, and other ingredients that the user selects from those provided in the app.

## Benefits: 
This will help busy social event coordinators/planners, with limited time, to find mixed drink recipes to help them plan their social events. This app will also help bartenders and anyone searching for new mixed drink recipes and suggestions.
